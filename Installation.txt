**HOW TO INSTALL:**
 
 
 
1. make a backup of your entire damned folder located normally at: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common
 
2. copy the folders in the RAR file named "Damned-master"
 
3. paste the copied folders into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Damned       
   and overwrite anything it asks you to (this is why you have a backup!)
 
4. launch game and play!
 
5. report any bugs you may find in the "PTB-bug_reports" tab in the Damned discord, or on the Bug report section on the steam forums.
 
 
 
 
 
 
if you ever want to revert to the original Damned, just delete your modified Damned folder at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common    and then paste your original back up there.
 
 
 
******IMPORTANT******
players on a test patch cannot play games with people playing the original base game. To revert, follow the instructions above, or in the video.
